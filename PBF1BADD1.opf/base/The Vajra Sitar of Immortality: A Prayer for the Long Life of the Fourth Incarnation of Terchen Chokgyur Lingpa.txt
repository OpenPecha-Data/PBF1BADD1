The Vajra Sitar of Immortality
A Prayer for the Long Life of the Fourth Incarnation of Terchen Chokgyur Lingpa
by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche

om svasti
Oṃ svasti!
rigdzin drub gyé chimé pema jung
Padmasambhava—forefather of hundreds of accomplished vidyādharas—
dechen gyurmé gyutrul yidam lha
Yidam deities—magical manifestations of unchanging great bliss—
dorjé chösung khandrö tsok ché kyi
And the assembly of vajra dharma-protectors and ḍākinīs,
den jin mejung nütü shipa tsol
Through your wondrous truth, may all be powerfully auspicious!

ngagyur kater tek chok mindrol gyi
Custodian of the liberating instructions and ripening empowerments
tendzin khedrub wangpö kutsé dang
Of the Supreme Vehicle, the Kama and Terma of the Ancient Translations,
tukkyé trinlé karpö da shyön shyin
Lord of scholars and sages—like the full moon rising bright above,
charwé chok lé nampar gyal gyur chik
May your life, awakened vision and activity reign victorious over all!

kabab dünden terchen chö kyi jé
May the tradition of the Great Tertön, the King of Dharma,
ringluk si tar dzokden dü tön shyin
Holder of the seven special transmissions,
getsen mejung shipé metok gi
Remain until the end of time, like a celebration from the Golden Age—
jikten sum na taktu dzé gyur chik
The three worlds forever adorned by this auspicious flower of wondrous goodness!

Since the sons of the siddha1 together with some sangha members from Tenchok Gyurmé Ling2 requested
me to offer a long life prayer using the name Rigdzin Gyurmé Dorjé3 bestowed by the
embodiment of the victors of the three times, the Sixteenth Gyalwang Karmapa, I, Maṅgala
Śrī Bhuti, a tantric practitioner who was touched by the nectar of Jamgön Khyentsé’s blessing,
composed this prayer in the presence of the Kutsap Yizhin Norbu Ngödrup Palbar.4 May
these aspirations come true!
