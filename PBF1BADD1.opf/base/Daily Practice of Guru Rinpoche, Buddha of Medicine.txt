Daily Practice of Guru Rinpoche, Buddha of Medicine
by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche

rangnyi kechik dren dzok su
Perfect in the instant of recollection,
orgyen men gyi lama ni
I am the Oḍḍiyāna Buddha of Medicine—
ting sal men chok lhungzé nam
Bright blue, holding supreme medicine and alms-bowl,
nyen shyu sang gö pö ber sol
And wearing hat, undergarment, gown and cloak—
jinlab ziji denpar sal
Resplendent with blessings and majestic presence.
om ah hung benza guru pema sambhawa bhekandzé radza samudgaté soha
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padmasambhava bhaiṣajyarājasamudgate svāhā
Recite this mantra.
gewa di yi nyurdu dak
Through this merit, may I swiftly accomplish the realization
orgyen men la drub gyur né
Of Orgyen, Buddha of Medicine,
drowa chik kyang malüpa
And may I bring each and every single living being
dé yi sa la göpar shok
To that perfect state as well.

By Maṅgala.
