A Prayer to Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche
by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche

künkhyab gyurmé rangjung dorjé sem
You reveal the natural state of self-arisen Vajrasattva,
neluk töndzé tekchok dzogpa ché
All-pervasive and unchanging, and hoist the sublime victory-banner
tsawa yenlak tenpé gyaltsen chok
Of the root and branch teachings of the Great Perfection, supreme among vehicles—
dreng dzé palden lamar solwa deb
Glorious guru, to you I pray!

I (Dilgo Khyentse) spoke this myself in accordance with a request from Pegyal Lingpa, a practitioner
of profound treasures and upholder of the enlightened activities of Padmākara, king
of the victorious ones. May its meaning be actualized!
