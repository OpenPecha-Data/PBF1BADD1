The Precious Jewel Essence: A Prayer of the Four Dharmas
by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche

pa chik lama orgyen dorjé chang
Orgyen Dorje Chang, my own father and guru,
dak gyü dampé chö kyi chok su shyol
May my mind turn towards the sacred Dharma,
samjor tamché namkhyen lam du shyuk
All my thoughts and actions accord with the path of omniscience,
lam chok trulmé tekchen ta gom chö
And my view, meditation and conduct be of Mahāyāna, the supreme and unmistaken path.
trulnang yeshe charwé nyamlen gyi
When deluded perception dawns as wisdom through practice,
chö gyé chingdral wenpé ri sul du
May I be free from the bonds of the eight worldly concerns, and as I stay in solitary among
mountains,
shyenpen changchub sem kyi samjor gyi
With the aspiration and action of bodhicitta, for the benefit of others,
palgön lamé gong gyü jishyin du
May I act according to the glorious protector guru's wisdom transmission,
chöpé dömé tsensa zinpar shok
And seize the primordial stronghold.
In accordance with a request from  meditating monks from France, such as Kunzang Longdrol, who
excels as an attendant in the three ways of pleasing the guru, I, Maṅgala, a carefree and
spacious old man, made this aspiration with a joyous mind. May it be accomplished!
