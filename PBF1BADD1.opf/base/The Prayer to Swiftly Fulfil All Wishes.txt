A Prayer to Swiftly Fulfil All Wishes
by Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche

om swasti
Oṃ svasti
chok dü tsa sum gyalwé yeshe ku
Lordly Guru, wisdom kāya of all buddhas and deities
drenpé dödön kün tsol guru jé
Of the three roots throughout all time and directions, to simply recall you fulfills all wishes;
nyikdü ten dang drowa tadak la
With your love, exalted knowledge and power,
kyobpé khyen tsé nü pa tsal truk dzö
Pray protect all beings and the Dharma during these most decadent of times!

gyalten rinchen nyingpö sokdzin ching
Pray come quickly from the gandhola of the supreme field of Lotus Light,
gelek nangwé dü kyi gü sal chir
To beautify this earth; show a magnificent aspect,
shying chok pema ö kyi gandho la
As holder of the life force, the very heart of the precious Buddha’s teachings,
yik dzin dzepé gyen du nyur char dzö
To clear away the decadence of the age.

chi nang barché dü dré tsewa shyi
Pacify the aggression of demons and enemies,
tünkyen dögu karchok lhami drub
As well as all obstacles — both outer and inner —
dorjé jin chen maha guru yi
And grant us everything we desire with favorable circumstances.
ngönsum tsal né nyurdu drubpar dzö
Mahāguru, with your vajra blessing fulfill our wishes, right now!

Sharpa Tsenam, one of a very pure disposition wrought through former aspirations, accompanied
the request for this prayer with the offering of a celestial scarf. And I, a follower of
Padmasambhava, Garwang Ösel Do-ngak Dechen Lingpa, wrote this after invoking the aspiration
of the oceanic objects of refuge, with the aspiration that it may be useful for the faithful;
that it might serve as a support for the swift fulfilment of their wishes in accordance
with the Dharma.
