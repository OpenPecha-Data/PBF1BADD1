The potent, extraordinary power of your warmth a friend to the lotus buds of sentient beings
and the teaching of Buddha—

May your supreme three secrets remain forever.

Through sincere motivation, faith and commitment,

Accompanied by the infinite blessing of the Three Rare and Sublime Ones,
jitar solwa tab shyin nyur drubpé

Ushering in the highest, most beautiful auspiciousness throughout saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.

When the sublime guru's attendant Sherab Gyaltsen issued a request accompanied by the support
of a gift, I, Gyurme Tekchok Tenpé Gyaltsen, the lowest disciple who was happily cared for
by the previous dharma king, composed this supplication on 15th January 1991, praying one-pointedly
with great devotion in the presence of the sacred Vajra Seat (Bodhgayā), the
central place of the Jambu continent. Siddhirastu!
