A! My own rigpa, unaltered, is and always has been Vajrasattva,

Spontaneously perfect; above my head is the embodiment of all the buddha families,

Mañjughoṣa in person: the great Chökyi Lodrö,1

At this master's forehead is Jñāna Vajra—Jikdral Yeshe Dorje,2

At his throat is Ayudharma—Tsering Chödrön3—the lake-arisen Sarasvatī,
tukkar dorje ziji pal du bar
At his heart is Dorje Ziji Tsal—Khyentse Wangpo—blazing in splendour,
tewar trinlé mangala nepa
And at his navel is Maṅgala—Tashi Paljor4—his enlightened activity.
dakchen yongdrub mögü riktsal gyi
Rigpa’s radiance arises as devotion which accomplishes the great purity (of perception),
soldeb wang dang jinlab ngödrub tsol
With that I pray: grant me empowerments, blessings and siddhis!
rangrik lamar shepé jedren na
Recognizing and remembering that my own rigpa is the Lama—
tuk yi chik tu drepar jingyi lob
Through this blessing, may your mind and mine merge as one!

hung
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra mahāguru mañjughoṣa dharmamati jñānavajra ayudipaṃ maṅgala sarva siddhi hūṃ

At the request of Tulku Sönam Gyaltsen, a great source of knowledge, love, compassion and noble
qualities, this was written by Maṅgala, an old man of Kham. May its meaning and purpose
be fulfilled!
