A Prayer for the Spread of Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche’s Termas
by Trulshik Rinpoche

om swasti
Oṃ svasti!
terchen dil khyen dorjé chang chenpö
The great tertön, the majestic Vajradhara, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche,
zabter drolwa shyiden lamzang chok
Revealed an excellent and most supreme path – profound treasures possessed of the four modes
of liberation.1
dzamling chi dang bé yul char tokpar
May they spread far and wide throughout the entire world and all hidden lands,
dargyé yün né dön nyi lhündrub shok
Endure long into the future, and bring spontaneous benefit for both self and other.

As requested by Lama Jigme of Khawalung Gompa, this was written by Dzarong Trulshik Chökyi Lodrö,
a humble disciple of the dharma lord, during the Earth Ox year (2009).
