Prayer for the Long Life of Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche
by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche

om swasti
Oṃ svasti!
jamyang khyenpé chuter lé trung shing
Born from the lake of Mañjughoṣa’s wisdom (Jamyang Khyentse),
chökyi gyatsö ngadak dorjé chen
You are the adamantine sovereign of the oceanic dharma.
rik sum yermé chok gi trulpé ku
Supreme emanation inseparable from the three protectors.1
sang sum pomé takpar shyuk soldeb
I pray to you: may your three secrets remain without change.

dom sum tsultrim namdak ser gyi shyir
Upon the golden ground of the three sets of vows kept purely,
talé sen sam gompé yönten ter
The treasures—qualities of boundless study, contemplation and meditation—
tar sön norbü dzöden roltsö dzé
Are perfected within the peaceful ocean of your mind, a beautiful treasury of gems.
chok gi tulkü sang sum takten shok
Supreme tulku, may your three secrets remain forever.

shé gyü ka chen chu yi ringluk pel
May your extraordinary actions—of cultivating a learned and accomplished saṅgha,
drubgyü shingté mindrol gyün mi ché
Explaining and spreading the long-standing tradition of the Ten Great Pillars,2
khé tsün drubpé dü tsok tak kyong dzö
Along with the flow of the ripening empowerments and liberating instructions of the pioneers
of the practice lineage—endure.
ngotsar nangwa taktu gyal gyur chik
And may your wondrous illuminating influence expand and increase for evermore!

The attendant of the sublime tulku, the Bhutanese monastic Sherab Gyaltsen, made an offering
and requested a longevity supplication. Accordingly, I, Thekchok Tenpe Gyaltsen, a happy
follower of the Gentle Protector, father and son, made this aspiration and wrote it down.
